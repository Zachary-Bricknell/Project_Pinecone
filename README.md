## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a proof of concept that utilizes modern noise reduction techniques in LiDAR scans to convert a scanned tree into a tree taper model.
Originally the only way to obtain various information such as the Diameter, Age, and Height of a tree was through destructive sampling. With this project, we aim to reduce or
eliminate the need for destructive sampling and have on-demand access to up-to-date information at any given time. We are working closely with the MNRF to utilize this technology.

## Features
- **LiDAR Data Processing**: Ability to process and clean raw LiDAR scans of Red Pine Trees.
- **Tree Taper Model Generation**: Convert cleaned LiDAR scans into tree taper models.
- **On-Demand Tree Information**: Retrieve Diameter, Age, Height, and other relevant statistics from the generated taper.
